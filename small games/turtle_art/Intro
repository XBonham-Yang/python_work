This project is also to learn about class. I used turtle graphic and colorcharm.

The target is to re-create Hrist's dot art.
There are one art picture, main.py
and painting_art.py file.

In the main file, I used the turtle graphic to practise drawing different things
those codes need to run one at a time.

In the painting_art file, I extracted colours from the art picture I downloaded
and deleted the "white" colours from my colour list.
Then I used the colours for my turtle to create a 10*10 dot art.
